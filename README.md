# Skins Pro — **Next-Gen Home Assistant Dashboard**

[中文版本](README.zh-CN.md)

**Next-Gen Home Assistant Dashboard** — Multi-skin, immersive, plug-and-play.

Skins Pro is a community Lovelace card with a multi-skin architecture. It ships with the **modern** skin and offers additional skins via the built-in skin store. Bilingual (CN/EN) — install from HACS and it just works.

- Add via HACS custom repository
- Switch between skins freely
- Fullscreen Kiosk mode for immersive experience
- Area-based room display
- Auto icon resolution from Home Assistant
- Force fullscreen lock for non-admin users

> Note — We often create skins out of passion for the things we like, but this can inadvertently touch on copyright issues. We recommend using AI-generated images whenever possible. All current theme image assets are AI-generated, so some images may contain AI watermarks or similar generation artifacts. If you don't like the AI-generated images, you can freely upload your own background and room images in the settings. If you believe any skin infringes on your copyright, please open an issue and we will remove it promptly.

## Philosophy

Keep it simple, keep it easy.

Skins Pro is built around simplicity and ease of use. Install from HACS, pick a skin, adjust a few settings in the card editor, and you're done. Every feature is designed to be intuitive, so you can focus on enjoying your smart home.

## Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and add this repository in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=ha-china&repository=Skins-Pro&category=plugin)

Click the button above, or manually:

1. HACS → Custom Repositories → Add `https://github.com/ha-china/Skins-Pro`, category: Dashboard

## Skin Store

![Store](https://github.com/ha-china/Skins-Pro/raw/screenshot-assets/store.gif)

Download additional skins directly from the card editor. Clicking **Download** fetches the skin package from the CDN and installs it to your HA `www/` directory via the [`skins-pro-hass`](https://github.com/ha-china/skins-pro-hass) integration.

> The integration is only needed for downloading skins from the store. If you only use the built-in **modern** skin, you can skip installing it.

## Built-in Skin

| Skin | Style | Features |
|---|---|---|
| **modern** (default) | White glassmorphism | Frosted glass, high-res images, clean blue-white palette, built-in dark mode |

> All other skins (AEON, AEON_glass, visionOS, minecraft, and community submissions) are available via the **Skin Store** built into the card editor. Click the store button to browse and download.
